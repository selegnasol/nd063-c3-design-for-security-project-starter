Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.

# Poor practice 1
I ran an intensive Zenmap scan to identify and confirm open ports on the application server with IP address [18.211.210.0]. Ports 22 and 5000 appear to be open. If SSH service is configured insecurely, this would allow a malicious user (hacker) to bruteforce into ROOT account. See attached screenshot (E1T4_Zenmap.png)

# Poor practice 2
WebAppSG security group is not configured properly! This security group allows ingress traffic from the internet to the web service instance on ports 80 and 5000 and allows all egress traffic from the server, even though the application is behind an application load balancer. This exposes EC2 instance to various types of attacks.

# Poor practice 3
All secure communication should be done over port 443 (SSL/TLS)! Port 80 is vulnerable to attacks on web clients: SQL injections, cross-site request forgeries, cross-site scripting, and buffer overruns. Furthermore, all communication between a user and the server can be sniffed by an attacker (MITM) on the same network.
