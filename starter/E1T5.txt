Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.

# Poor practice 1
I ran an intensive Zenmap scan to identify/confirm open ports and security issues on the application server with public IP address [18.211.210.0]. Ports 22 and 5000 appear to be open. If SSH service is configured insecurely in EC2 instance, this would allow a malicious user to bruteforce into ROOT account over port 22. See attached screenshot (E1T4_zenmap.png)

# Poor practice 2
WebAppSG security group is not configured properly. This sec group allows all egress traffic from the server, even though the application is behind an application load balancer. Additionally, this sec group allows ingress traffic to the web service instance on ports 80 and 5000. This exposes EC2 instance to certain types of attacks from the internet.

# Poor practice 3
All secure communication should be done over port 443 (SSL/TLS), not 80! Port 80 is vulnerable to these types of attacks: SQL injections, cross-site request forgeries, XSS, and buffer overruns. Furthermore, all communication between a user and the server can potentially be sniffed by an attacker (MITM) sitting on the same WLAN/LAN network.
