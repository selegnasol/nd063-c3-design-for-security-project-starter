Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.

Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.

Issues:
- Minimum length for passwords is not configured on instance i-0e2de6ac8dd906d5c in your assessment target
- On instance i-0e2de6ac8dd906d5c, process 'sshd' is listening on TCP port 22 which is associated with 'SSH' and is reachable from the internet
- S3 buckets should have server-side encryption enabled

Remediations:
- Configure minimum password length
- Close port 22 and all other non-necessary ports on the EC2 instance
- Enable default S3 server-side encryption
