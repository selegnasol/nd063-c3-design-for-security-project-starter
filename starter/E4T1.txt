# Identify 2-3 changes that can be made to our environment to prevent an ssh brute force attack from the internet.
- Disable SSH password login on 'Web Service Instance - C3'
- Don't allow ssh passwords: use private key authentication
- Restrict internet access only to specific IP address ranges

# Neither instance should have had access to the secret recipes bucket; even in the instance that API credentials were compromised how could we have prevented access to sensitive data?
- Use least privilege access: modify c3-app-InstanceRole IAM role to grant access only to the free recipes bucket
- Use default server-side encryption for S3 bucket using AWS managed key (SSE-S3)
- Use Customer Master Keys (CMKs) stored in the AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) for server-side encryption for S3 bucket
